Hello, I am Blanca and I am 6 years old and it is in my question, how is the coronavirus spread

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:18,970
 HEADBOARD

00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,849
 How do we get the coronavirus? When you sneeze, cough and even talk,

4
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:29,560
 Thousands of tiny droplets of saliva are expelled from your mouth. They're so

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,879
 small ones that can remain floating in the air for several minutes, and if

6
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:37,960
 sneeze or cough loudly, they shoot out with such force that they

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,129
 reach several meters away staining surfaces and objects at their

8
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:47,890
 He passed. It is completely normal. The problem comes if you are sick. Yes

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,600
 you have a cold or flu or coronavirus, in addition to saliva those micro

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,510
 droplets contain viral particles. If at that moment some person

11
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,610
 is nearby, you can breathe in those droplets with viruses and become infected. If you touch a

12
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,290
 stained surface and then inadvertently touching your face, the virus can also

13
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,450
 enter through your mouth, nose or eyes. This is how you can get infected with the virus. But,

14
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,009
 What happens when it enters the body? Once inside the coronavirus joins some

15
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:22,840
 special proteins on the surface of your cells. In this way they manage to enter

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,380
 and take advantage of the machinery of the cell to create thousands upon thousands of

17
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,330
 copies of himself. The new viruses in turn can enter other cells and

18
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:36,160
 produce even more viruses. Soon there are so many viruses that the body looks for a way to

19
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,770
 get rid of them: cough, sneeze ... and with it, thousands of droplets with viruses

20
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,170
 they shoot out. Does it sound familiar to you? We have returned to the beginning.

21
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,540
 This is how these viruses manage to survive and pass from one person to another.

22
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,560
 But what can we do to stop it? What steps can we take to not

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,830
 infect us or pass it on to other people?

24
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,920
 Surely seeing how viruses are transmitted you have already thought of several

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,090
 ways to avoid it, but we are going to summarize them all so that we do not

26
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,280
 none in the pipeline. 1. wash your hands with soap and water often to

27
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:19,180
 thus eliminate possible viruses and microbes 2 when you sneeze or cough, never, never

28
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,920
 do it directly on a person. Use a handkerchief or elbow if you don't have

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,330
 one by hand. It is better not to use your hands. When we use our hands we are

30
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,880
 filling with viruses and then we can spread these viruses by touching something.

31
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,500
 3. Keep a safe distance of at least 2 meters from people. So you avoid

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,590
 that when you speak, breathe or cough, possible viruses reach your body. 4. Use

33
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,150
 mask when you are going to be around other people. Thus, those microdroplets

34
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,950
 with viruses are trapped inside and cannot get out, and in turn the droplets that

35
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,880
 there are in the air they cannot enter your body. It is the best possible barrier.

36
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,010
 5. And finally, if you are sick, stay home. This way you avoid passing the virus to others

37
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,840
 people and you can rest and heal calmly. As you can see, they are very

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,640
 simple, but thanks to them we prevent viruses from spreading uncontrollably and

39
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,380
 that vulnerable people can fall seriously ill. Meanwhile, the

40
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,920
 Scientists around the world are going crazy creating a special vaccine against

41
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,360
 the coronavirus. When we have it, with a simple injection we will all be

42
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,430
 protected against the virus. There is less left to achieve it. If you liked it
