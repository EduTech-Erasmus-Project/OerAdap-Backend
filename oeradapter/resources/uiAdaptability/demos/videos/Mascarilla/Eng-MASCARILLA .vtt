00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
we go with the masks which is one of the things that most

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.590
concern has given to see here we have the mask I do not know if you are seeing

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.740
If there is no mask and you have a scarf, use the scarf if you have those as hats

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.030
that he does not put on, he can download the books that are called put on and see

5
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.869
let's see here we have the mask is not true if you can see here

6
00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.480
we have a white side and here we have a blue side I've already seen a lot of people

7
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.500
who puts the mask on the side that seems best to him and that we have repeated several

8
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.960
times the white side friends in contact the white side is from the filter that is, it is

9
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.100
the filter if you have the flu or think you have been in contact

10
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.039
suspect with someone who has coronavirus the filter must go to

11
00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:54.100
inside near your face so that droplets of saliva do not come out where

12
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.260
virus can be deposited on walking surfaces virus no grandmother

13
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.730
the virus does not have legs the virus is chubby and heavy they fall to

14
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.320
surfaces today Mrs. Gina Watson was saying something very interesting that one of

15
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.460
the surfaces where the video is held the most

16
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.080
and that we have to talk about on the sets and everywhere is glass and we have to

17
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.880
clean the video well with chlorine water solution and that information is in

18
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.659
the pages of the ministry of health that you can calmly enter

19
00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.159
a little while with your cell phone and be able to investigate to see then we have the

20
00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.250
white part is the filter if I am with everyone with the flu the white part

21
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.100
seeing that here there is one as a fierrito I do not know if you have felt that there is one

22
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.270
as a puppy here you see a puppy this part I would say in my mouth so that it does not come out

23
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.630
perfect now if you just want to avoid contagion

24
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.250
If you just want to go out and thank God you have a mask

25
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.410
the idea is that the blue part goes to his face and the white part goes out

26
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.850
I read a study of Chinese people who when they were wearing the

27
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.200
masks according to the color they had on the street they knew it was a

28
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.550
suspicious person like that is a person who was not suspicious then

29
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.239
Let's consider the white part again if you are with everyone suspicious of

30
00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.180
coronavirus into the mouth so that it does not come out

31
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.439
it does not have that out so that nothing enters that I think we have enough

32
00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.280
of course that's one thing, let's go with the second thing the same if the friends of

33
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.579
contact you have any questions then welcome and let's see here I have my

34
00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.379
dear federico who has been with me for 23 years in this year that we do the program

35
00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.139
of a new lifestyle many of the friends in contact in my darlings

36
00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.980
friends, I am not going to whom from being born there are still 300 they are young people to see

37
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.370
come on and symptoms if it is from the neck up, tranquility there

38
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.909
people who say doctor is that I already have a sore throat is itching me

39
00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.019
itches my ears I have a list for me I already have coronavirus no end now and yes

40
00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.419
you have a discharge from your nose that white mosquito that comes out like water

41
00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:04.219
tranquility from the neck up tranquility now if it is

42
00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:08.719
that suddenly begins to see fever for that in airports to everyone

43
00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.439
they are taking the fever or they are taking forgiveness the temperature does not the

44
00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:17.169
the fever is taking the temperature if it starts to have a fever

45
00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:23.210
discomfort and these symptoms of sore throat go down into the lungs

46
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.340
and if it is another song if they go down to the lungs that is another song we are

47
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.120
clear then if I am with pain in the chest if I feel

48
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.720
Like it bothers me like I have a dry drink because he all in this

49
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.790
it is dry because this virus does not like to stay in the throat the virus will

50
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.600
love lungs and this is where you really want to live in the

51
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.850
lungs then to see from here up tranquility if you start to see

52
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.520
fever and do not go down calm if you have a runny nose calm if it is

53
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.990
that lowers the discomfort with fever there is no discharge

54
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.440
there is discomfort like the strikes that normally has given us all

55
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.600
mulatto with those flu that sends us to bed immediately, do not go to a

56
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.209
medical center go to the places that the ministry of health has designated by

57
00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.659
what to be swarming everywhere is to have to start from the virus of all

58
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.780
people we are clear then these two things are important
