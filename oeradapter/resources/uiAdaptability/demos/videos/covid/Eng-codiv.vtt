00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.980
[Music] well the coronavirus or has taken a

2
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.949
importance in this 2020 is how we woke up with the coronavirus as a

3
00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.310
threatens the first of January since on December 31 China gave the notice to the network

4
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.529
world health that there was an outbreak of a viral infection an infection that

5
00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.860
they did not know specifically who caused it and that as in other epidemics

6
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.860
seemed to have an animal origin that we know coronaviruses are viruses are

7
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.739
very simple structures are almost a mile

8
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.280
microorganism which makes it easy to spread from person to person

9
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.760
another on December 1st apparently as far as we can

10
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.760
understand 2019 a person acquired in a market where they are sold

11
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.990
animals either for food consumption or as pets a coronavirus virus

12
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.300
whether it is a pangolin bat or a reptile bat is not yet well determined.

13
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.500
transmitted by a human being the problem with this virus is that it could be transmitted

14
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.890
from that human being to another human being the four old coronaviruses that

15
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.289
we knew they produce 15 percent of the common flu and because I speak of

16
00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:40.920
these 4 old and known coronaviruses because they are a common cause of problems

17
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.799
respiratory diseases in humans in 2002 the first coronavirus appeared

18
00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.189
aggressive was called you know also appeared in china in the city of guandong and

19
00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.289
it was also transmitted by an animal is a type of cat that they use there to

20
00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:05.369
feeding and produced at that time the death of eight thousand individuals a

21
00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.750
mortality of 9 percent and was the first big alarm that the

22
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.370
coronavirus could behave with an aggressive respiratory virus

23
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.549
in 2012 the second aggressive coronavirus appears, this is called merz

24
00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.519
because he appreciated in the middle east medel this respiratory syndrome and here it was

25
00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.549
transmitted by a camel to a human being and the human being transmits it to

26
00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.590
another human being the same as what happened with the tsar what is the difference well

27
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.590
that this virus instead of having a mortality of 9 percent of a

28
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.940
34 percent mortality if one in three people get this disease

29
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.500
he is going to die and in 2019 on December 31 we will speak

30
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.140
of the appearance of this third new coronavirus now called cobit 2019

31
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.900
where the origin seems to be as bat or a vague link commented to them and has

32
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.580
had two characteristics that have made this virus especially dangerous

33
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.500
it can first be spread when the individual does not yet have symptoms that

34
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.820
means that in the incubation period we call when I acquire

35
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.660
to the virus when it developed the symptoms I can get to infect the

36
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.980
disease and then in that period the person is totally asymptomatic what

37
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.840
which makes it very complex to determine when to isolate a

38
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.940
person because they will not have symptoms and secondly it is a virus with a capacity to

39
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.460
extraordinary dissemination the best example is that after china the

40
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.530
second place where there have been more cases of coronavirus is on a cruise ship where

41
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.820
kept more than 400 people fixed on that cruise ship and there are more than 200 cases of

42
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.410
infected people is to say if I am in contact with people

43
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.210
who has coronavirus I am going to be infected and unfortunately being a virus

44
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.730
new because it comes from an animal none of the human beings before the first

45
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.020
December 2019 had antibodies against this virus which

46
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.730
which makes the entire population of the world susceptible to developing this

47
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.230
luckily from the news we have and from the studies

48
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.480
epidemiological studies that have been shown this virus has a lethality rate

49
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.440
mortality less than 2 percent say we are not going to die all of

50
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.310
coronavirus but if we are going to have to take care because there are people

51
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.300
especially older people who have diabetes who have

52
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.860
obesity who have heart problems that can die from this disease is

53
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.790
a rule that is going to reach Mexico you have to be forewarned you have to be

54
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:52.279
pay attention you have to take care [Music]
