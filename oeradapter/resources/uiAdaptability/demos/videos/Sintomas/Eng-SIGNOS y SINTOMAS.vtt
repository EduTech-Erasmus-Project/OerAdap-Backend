00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.970
According to information provided by the Chinese CDC as of January 28,

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.879
2020 the ages of confirmed cases ranged from 9 months to 96 years

4
00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.170
According to the information provided by the who as of January 27, 2020, the

5
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.779
cases of dictations in countries other than China had an average age of 45 years

6
00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.480
with a range between 2 and 74 years, with 71 percent of the cases being men

7
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.560
start of the outbreak no cases of children were described

8
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.350
subsequently, involvement has been described in children with mild symptoms or even

9
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.500
absence of symptoms that have been related to a dynamic of

10
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.399
intrafamily transmission the clinical picture varies from a picture

11
00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.949
mild upper respiratory tract with one or more of the following symptoms dyspnea

12
00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.030
cough sore throat and / or fever to severe pneumonia with sepsis

13
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.340
Kobe 19 cases can present asymptomatic four mild moderate or

14
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.320
severe pneumonia including acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis and

15
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.130
septic shock the early edification of those with

16
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.490
severe manifestations allows optimized supportive treatments

17
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.140
immediate and safe admission or referral to the care unit

18
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.580
intensive according to regional or national protocols

19
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.330
the recognition of the severity in the presence of pneumonia is carried out

20
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.950
immediately in the initial evaluation if there is presence of insufficiency

21
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.910
respiratory oxygen structuring less than 90% breathing air

22
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.520
environment a respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute a

23
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.880
More comprehensive evaluation of the severity of pneumonia will be performed by

24
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.370
scales such as curp and 65 scales that are useful in the initial decision of

25
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.510
specialization as support for clinical judgment data on severe

26
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.560
The severity of confirmed cases has varied over time.

27
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.310
which is common during outbreaks of emerging diseases in which

28
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.420
Initially, the most serious cases are detected and as it evolves, the

29
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.790
identify cases mild scale sofa sepsis wright organ file

30
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.490
assessment is used in severe pneumonia or sepsis mainly in the ICU to

31
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.750
quantify organ failure and for evolutionary monitoring
